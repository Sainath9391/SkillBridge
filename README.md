## 🧩 Overview

**SkillBridge** is an AI-driven learning ecosystem that bridges the gap between **education and employability**.  
It transforms how students **learn, apply, and prove** their skills through **AI project evaluation**, **real-world applications**, and **verified digital portfolios**.

> “We don’t just give certificates — we give proof of skill.”

---

## 🎯 Mission

To **bridge the gap between learning and employability** by enabling students to build real-world projects, get AI-based evaluations, and create verified portfolios showcasing their growth and technical competence.

---

## 💡 The Problem

Most edtech platforms stop at:
- Providing online courses  
- Issuing certificates after quizzes or assignments  

They fail to assess:
- Whether students can apply their skills to **real-world problems**  
- How **efficient** or **innovative** their solutions are  
- How much **growth** a student shows over time  

As a result:
🎓 Students have certificates but no **proof of practical ability**, and  
🏢 Employers struggle to verify **job readiness**.

---
